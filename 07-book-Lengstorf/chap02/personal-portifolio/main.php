      <h2>Ricochet Rabbit</h2>
      <p>
        Ricochet Rabbit & Droop-a-Long was a segment of Hanna-Barbera's 
        1964â€“1966 cartoon The Magilla Gorilla Show, and later appeared 
        on The Peter Potamus Show.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking place in a Wild West setting, Ricochet Rabbit (voiced by 
        Don Messick) worked as a sheriff in the town of Hoop 'n' Holler. 
        Ricochet would bounce off stationary objects yelling 'Bing-bing-bing!' 
        His deputy and foil Droop-a-Long Coyote (voiced by Mel Blanc 
        impersonating Ken Curtis) was not as fast and was very clumsy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to his speed, which enabled him to outrun bullets, 
        Ricochet used trick bullets against his opponents, including a 
        bullet that would stop in mid-flight and strike the target with 
        an impossibly oversized mallet, and another which would draw a 
        target on his nose and punch it.
